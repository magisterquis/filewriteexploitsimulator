File Write Exploit Simulator
============================
Simulates an arbitrary file write exploit.  Written to demonstrate how being
able to stick arbitrary data in arbitrary files is one step away from code
execution.

Very much not production-quality code.  Don't run this unless you know exactly
what you're doing.  Put it nowhere near the internet.

For legal use only.

Features
--------
- Arbitrary file write
- Arbitrary file read
- JSON logging
- Optional required HTTP basic auth
- Logged creds
- Questionable code quality
- TLS with a self-signed certificate

Quickstart
----------
Make sure to have the Go compiler [installed](https://go.dev/doc/install).

1.  Download and build
    ```sh
    go install github.com/magisterquis/filewriteexploitsimulator@latest
    ```
2.  Start serving
    ```sh
    filewriteexploitsimulator -write-root / -basic-auth kittens:zoomies
    ```
    There'll be a log line with the TLS fingerprint, something like
    ```
    {"time":"2024-04-18T00:46:17.41510871+02:00","level":"INFO","msg":"Starting HTTPS server","address":"0.0.0.0:4433","tls_fingerprint":"9nkpEPFYzXMxoVTGImPROp+qkk+B1QQIut2jX4qohgY="}
    ```
3.  Send someone a cURL comand
    ```sh
    curl -u kittens:zoomies -svk --pinnedpubkey sha256//9nkpEPFYzXMxoVTGImPROp+qkk+B1QQIut2jX4qohgY= https://10.2.0.2:4433
    ```

Usage
-----
```
Usage: filewriteexploitsimulator [options]

Simulates an arbitrary file write exploit.  Not safe.

Options:
  -basic-auth username:password
    	If set, required basic auth username:password
  -debug
    	Enable debug logging
  -listen address
    	Listen address (default "0.0.0.0:4433")
  -log logfile
    	Optional logfile
  -perms mode
    	Octal file mode, for file creation (default "0644")
  -read-root directory
    	Root directory for file reads (default "/")
  -request-timeout duration
    	Maximum HTTP request duration (default 10m0s)
  -server-header header
    	HTTP Server header (default "filewriteexploitsimulator v0.0.0")
  -write-root directory
    	Root directory for file writes
```

Arbitrary Read
--------------
Anything under the directory specified with `-read-root` (by default `/`) may
be read by passing the path to a file or directory as the path of a GET
request.

Arbitrary Write
---------------
If `-write-root` is set to a directory files under that directory may be
written with a POST request.  Missing directories won't be created.

For a true exploit simulation, run as root with `-write-root /`.

Security
--------
In practical terms, none.

A username and password can be set with `-basic-auth`, but this should in no
way be trusted.  On the other hand, it'd probably make a pretty neat demo
for a timing attack or stealing creds from logs or something.
